Presented on an unofficial participant talk event during OPLSS 2025.

## Abstract

Human spoken languages, like English, are often ambiguous and not formalized. Lojban is an attempt to construct a formalized human spoken language that aims to be logical and flexible yet unambiguous and simple. Founded nearly 40 years ago, Lojban has blossomed into a living language maintained by community, spoken by thousands around the world, and has been demonstrated in translation and in original works of prose and poetry.

In this introductory talk, we will briefly cover the pronunciation, grammar, basic vocabulary and formalization of Lojban. We will also illustrate how to express everyday conversation, logical predicate and even figurative literature in Lojban.
